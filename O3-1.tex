The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST; \url{http://lsst.org}) is a planned,
large-aperture, wide-field, ground-based telescope that will survey half the

explore a wide range of astrophysical questions, ranging from discovering
``killer'' asteroids, to examining the nature of Dark Energy.

The LSST will produce on average 15 terabytes of data per night, yielding an
(uncompressed) data set of over 100 petabytes at the end of its 10-year
mission.  To enable the wide variety of planned science, the LSST Project is
leading the construction of a new, general-purpose, high-performance,
scalable, well documented, open source data processing software stack for
O/IR surveys.  Prototypes of this stack are already capable of processing
data from existing cameras (e.g., SDSS, DECam, MegaCam), and form the basis
of the Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC) Survey data reduction pipeline.  In the
2020-ies, running on dedicated HPC facilities, this system will enable us to
process the LSST data stream in near real time, with full-dataset
reprocessings on annual scale.

In this paper, we review the science goals and the technical design of the
LSST, focusing on the data management system. We describe its software
stack and the data products it will generate. Finally, we discuss the 
exciting opportunities this new codebase represents both for LSST,
and the astronomical software community as a whole.

\section{ The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope }

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST; \url{http://lsst.org}) is and
automated astronomical survey system that will survey half the
sky every few nights in six optical bands from 320 to 1050 nm \citep{OP}. It
will explore a wide range of astrophysical questions, ranging from discovering
``killer'' asteroids, to examining the nature of Dark Energy.

The LSST consists of a large-aperture, wide-field, ground-based telescope
currently being constructed on El Penon peak of Cerro Pachon in the Chlean
Andes, a 3.2 gigapixel camera, presently being constructed by a collaboration
of institutions lead by the SLAC National Laboratory, and a data management
system, also currently in constructon.

The LSST will produce on average 15 terabytes of data per night, yielding an
(uncompressed) data set of over 100 petabytes at the end of its 10-year
mission.  To enable the wide variety of planned science, the LSST Project is
leading the construction of a new, general-purpose, high-performance,
scalable, well documented, open source data processing software stack for
O/IR surveys.  Prototypes of this stack are already capable of processing
data from existing cameras (e.g., SDSS, DECam, MegaCam), and form the basis
of the Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC) Survey data reduction pipeline.  In the
2020-ies, running on dedicated HPC facilities, this system will enable us to
process the LSST data stream in near real time, with full-dataset
reprocessings on annual scale.

\section{ The LSST Data Management System }
\label{sec:dm}

The rapid cadence and scale of the LSST observing program will produce
approximately 15 TB per night of raw imaging data\footnote{For
  comparison, the volume of all imaging data collected over a decade
  and published in SDSS Data Release 7 \citep{DR7} is approximately 16 TB.}. The large data volume, the real-time aspects, and the complexity of processing involved makes it impractical to defer the data reduction to the LSST end-users. Instead, the data collected by the LSST system will be automatically reduced to scientifically useful catalogs and images by the LSST Data Management (DM) system.
\\

The principal functions of the LSST Data Management system are to: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Process, in real time, the incoming stream of images generated by the camera system during observing by archiving raw images, generating alerts to new sources or sources whose properties have changed, and updating the relevant catalogs (``Level 1'' data products; \S~\ref{Sec:dp}).
\item Periodically process the accumulated survey data to provide a
  uniform photometric and astrometric calibration, measure the
  properties of all detected objects, and characterize objects based on their time-dependent behavior. The results of such a processing run form a {\em Data Release} (DR), which is a static, self-consistent data set suitable for use in performing scientific analyses of LSST data and publication of the results (the ``Level 2'' data products; \S~\ref{Sec:dp}). All data releases will be archived for the entire operational life of the LSST archive.
\item Facilitate the creation of added-value (``Level 3'';
  \S~\ref{Sec:dp}) data products, by providing suitable software,
  application programming interfaces (APIs),  
and computing infrastructure at the LSST data access centers.
\item Make all LSST data available through an interface that utilizes
community-based standards   to the maximum possible extent. Provide
  enough processing, storage, and network bandwidth to enable user
  analyses of the data without the need for petabyte-scale data
  transfers. 
\end{itemize}

Over the ten years of LSST operations and 11 data releases, this processing will result in a cumulative {\em processed} data size 
approaching 500 petabytes (PB) for imaging, and over 50 PB for the
catalog databases. The final data release catalog database alone is expected 
to be approximately 15 PB in size.

(application [red, top], middleware [purple, middle], and infrastructure [blue, bottom] layers) enables scalability, reliability, and evolutionary capability.} 
\label{Fig:DM1}
\end{figure}

The data management system is conceptually divided into three layers: an
infrastructure layer consisting of the computing, storage, and
networking hardware and system software; a middleware layer, which
handles distributed processing, data access, user interface, and
system operations services; and an applications layer, which includes
the data pipelines and products and the science data archives (see
Fig.~\ref{Fig:DM1}).

\caption{The LSST data flow from the mountain summit/base facility in
Chile to the data access center and archive centers in the U.S. and France.}
\label{Fig:DM2}
\end{figure*}

Physically, the DM system components will span four key facilities on three
continents: the Summit Facility at  Cerro Pach\'on (where the initial
detector cross-talk 
correction will be performed), the Base Facility in La Serena (which will serve
as a retransmission hub for data 
uploads to North America, as well as the data access center for the Chilean
community), the central Archive Facility at the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) in Champaign, Illinois, and a
satellite data processing center at Centre de Calcul de l'Institut National 
de Physique Nucleaire et de Physique des Particules (CC-IN2P3) in Lyon, France.
All Level 1 (nightly) and 50\% of Level 2 (data release) processing will take place at the
Archive Facility, which will also serve as a data access center
for the US community. The remaining 50\% of data processing will be performed at
the satellite center in Lyon.

The data will be transported between the centers over existing and new high-speed optical fiber 
links from South America to the U.S. (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:DM2}).
Although the data processing center will have substantial computing 
power (e.g., the central facility will peak at $\sim 1.6$~petaflops of 
compute power), the continuation of current trends suggests that the center will 
not qualify for the top 500 list by the time of first light.
Hence, while LSST is making a novel use of advances in information technology, 
it is not taking the risk of pushing the expected technology to the limit, reducing
the overall risk to the project. 
\\

A novel aspect of the LSST DM system will be its ``Level 3"
capabilities, allowing the end-users to create, store, and share
custom data products not created by standard LSST processing. These
could be new catalogs created by simple post-processing of the LSST
data release catalogs, or entirely new data products generated by
running custom code on raw LSST data. The LSST software stack (described
below) will be made available to LSST end-users, as a basis on which
to quickly build such code. Approximately 10\% of the total
budget for the LSST Archive Center compute and storage capacity has
been reserved for end-user, Level 3, processing support
infrastructure\footnote{Furthermore, the data management system 
architecture will enable Level 3 tasks to "piggyback" onto annual 
Level 2 reprocessings, leveraging considerable I/O and
computing resources employed in the production of a data release.}. 

\section{The LSST software stack}
\label{sec:dmstack}

The {\em LSST Software Stack} is a well documented, state-of-the-art,
high-performance, scalable, multi-camera, open source, O/IR survey
data processing and analysis system, built to enable LSST survey data
reduction and the writing of custom, user-driven, code for Level 3
processing. It comprises 
all science pipelines needed to accomplish LSST data processing tasks
(e.g., calibration, single frame processing, coaddition, image
differencing, multi-epoch measurement, asteroid orbit determination,
etc.), the necessary data 
access and orchestration middleware, as well as the database and user
interface components. 

Algorithm development for the LSST software builds on the expertize
and experience of prior large astronomical surveys (including SDSS,
Pan-STARRS, DES,  
SuperMACHO, ESSENCE,  DLS, CFHTLS, and UKIDSS). The pipelines written 
for these surveys have demonstrated that it is possible to carry out
largely autonomous data 
reduction of large data sets, automated detection of sources and
objects, and the  
extraction of scientifically useful characteristics of those objects. 
While firmly footed in this prior history, the LSST software stack has 
largely been written anew, for reasons of performance, extendability, and
maintainability. All LSST codes have been designed and implemented 
following sofware engineering best practices, including modularity, clear definition
of interfaces, continuous integration, 
utilization of unit testing, a single set of documentation and coding
standards, and others. The primary implementation language is Python and, where
necessary for performance reasons, C++\footnote{All components implemented 
in C++ have been wrapped and exposed as Python modules to the rest 
of the system. Python truly is the ``native language of LSST''.}.
See the contribution by Jenness et al. for more discussion on the 
architecture of the LSST software stack.

background estimation and preserves the diffuse structures in the resulting
coadd.  The full coadd can be browsed at \url{http://moe.astro.washington.edu/sdss}.}
\label{Fig:DMStripe82}
\end{figure}


The LSST data management software has been prototyped for over eight
years. It has been exercised in eight data challenges, with increasing
degrees of complexity. Besides processing simulated LSST data
(\S~\ref{sec:imsim}), it has been used to process images from CFHTLS
and SDSS \citep{DR7}. As an example,
Figure~\ref{Fig:DMStripe82} shows a small region in the vicinity of M2
taken from a large coaddition of SDSS Stripe 82 data, generated with LSST
software stack prototypes. 
\\

The LSST software stack is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, Version 3. The stack
prototype code and documentation are available via \url{http://ls.st/ug}.
Its open source nature, an open development
process, attention to software engineering, a long-term project
commitment and a modular design that can be modified for use with
other cameras 
may make it useful for the processing of imaging data beyond LSST.  

\subsection{             Data Products                    } 
\label{Sec:dp}

Data collected by the LSST telescope and camera will be automatically processed to {\em data products} -- catalogs, alerts,
and reduced images -- by the LSST Data Management system
(\S~\ref{sec:dm}). These products are designed to be sufficient to
enable a large majority of LSST science cases, without the need to
work directly with the raw pixels.  We give a high-level overview of
the LSST data products here; further details may be found in the LSST
Data Products Definition Document (Juri\'{c} et al. 2013). 

\vskip 1em

Two major categories of data products will be produced and delivered by LSST DM:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Level 1 data products}, designed to support the discovery,
  characterization, and rapid follow-up of time-dependent phenomena
  (``transient science''). These will be generated continuously every
  observing night, by detecting and characterizing sources in images
  differenced against deep templates. They will include alerts to
  objects that were newly discovered, or have changed brightness or
  position at a statistically significant level. The alerts to such
  events will be published within 60   seconds of observation.\\ 
\\
In addition to transient science, Level 1 data products will support
discovery and follow-up of objects in the Solar System. Objects with
motions sufficient to cause trailing in a single exposure will be
identified and flagged as such when the alerts are broadcast. Those
that are not trailed will be identified and linked based on their
motion from observation to observation, over a period of a few
days. Their orbits will be published within 24 hours of
identification. The efficiency of linking (and thus the completeness
of the resulting orbit catalog) will depend on the final observing
cadence chosen for LSST, as well as the performance of the linking
algorithm (\citep{MOPSIAU}).
\item {\bf Level 2 data products} are designed to enable systematics- and flux-limited science, and will be made available in annual Data Releases. These will include the (reduced and raw) single-epoch images, deep coadds of the observed sky, catalogs of objects detected in LSST data, catalogs of sources (the detections and measurements of objects on individual visits), and catalogs of ``forced sources" (measurements of flux on individual visits at locations where objects were detected by LSST or other surveys). LSST data releases will also include fully reprocessed Level 1 data products, as well as all metadata and software necessary for the end-user to reproduce any aspect of LSST data release processing.\\
\\
A noteworthy aspect of LSST Level 2 processing is that it will largely
rely on {\bf multi-epoch model fitting}, or {\bf \em MultiFit}, to
perform near-optimal characterization of object properties. That is,
while the coadds will be used to perform object {\em detection}, the
{\em measurement} of their properties will be performed by
simultaneously fitting (PSF-convolved) models to single-epoch
observations. An extended source model -- a constrained linear
combination of two S\'ersic profiles -- and a point source model with
proper motion -- will generally be 
fitted to each detected object\footnote{For performance reasons, it is
  likely that only the point source model will be fitted in the most
  crowded regions of the Galactic plane.}.\\ 
\\
Secondly, for the extended source model fits, the LSST will
characterize and store the shape of the associated likelihood surface
(and the posterior), and not just the maximum likelihood values and
covariances. The characterization will be accomplished by sampling,
with up to $\sim$200 (independent) likelihood samples retained for
each object. For storage cost reasons, these samples
may be retained only for those bands of greatest interest for
weak lensing studies. 

\end{itemize}


While a large majority of science cases will be adequately served by
Level 1 and 2 data products, a limited number of highly specialized
investigations may require custom, user-driven, processing of LSST
data. This processing will be most efficiently performed at the 
LSST Archive Center, given the size of the LSST data set and the
associated storage and computational challenges. To enable such use
cases, the LSST DM system will devote the equivalent of 10\% of its
processing and storage capabilities to creation, use, and federation
of {\bf Level 3} (user-created) data products. It will also allow the
science teams to use the LSST database infrastructure to store and
share their results. 

To further enable user-driven Level 3 processing, the LSST software
stack has been explicitly architected with reusability and
extendability in mind, and will be made available to the LSST user
community (\S~\ref{sec:dmstack}). This will allow the LSST users to
more rapidly develop custom Level 3 processing codes, leveraging 15+
years of investment and experience put into LSST codes. In addition to
executing such customized codes at the LSST data centers, LSST users
will be able to run it on their own computational resources as well.\\

We have described that approximately 10\% of the observing time will
be devoted to mini-surveys that do not follow the LSST baseline
cadence (\S~\ref{Sec:minisurveys}). The data products for these
programs will be generated using the same processing system and
exhibit the same general characteristics of Level 1 and 2 data
products, but these data may be reduced on a somewhat different
timescale.
